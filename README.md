# W3 MaxHeap - WordFreq

This program stores survey phrases as WordFreq objects and builds a max-heap
based on frequency (higher frequency = higher priority).

It uses bottom-up heap construction (buildMaxHeap) and maxHeapify to enforce
the max-heap property, then prints the array before and after heapification.
